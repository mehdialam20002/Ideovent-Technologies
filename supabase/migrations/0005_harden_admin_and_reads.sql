-- 0005: only the admin can write, and the public can read only what is public.
-- Written 25 September 2026, before the first real Supabase project was wired.
-- Safe to run more than once.
-- ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
--
-- TWO HOLES THIS CLOSES
--
-- 1. "authenticated" meant "anyone with an account", and anyone can make one.
--    0001 granted select, insert, update and delete on every row to the role
--    `authenticated`. A new Supabase project allows email sign-ups by default,
--    and the anon key that permits a sign-up is shipped in the site's JavaScript
--    by design. So a stranger could call supabase.auth.signUp() from the browser
--    console, become `authenticated`, and read every lead, every internship
--    application, every certificate grade, and then edit or delete the site.
--    Now every write, and every read of private rows, requires the signed-in
--    email to be in public.admins. Turn sign-ups off in the dashboard as well
--    (Authentication > Sign In / Providers > Allow new users to sign up): this
--    file is the lock, that switch is the second one.
--
-- 2. The public could list the whole sales pipeline.
--    "read public content" excluded the private collections but returned every
--    pitch page and every demo site, including drafts and closed ones. With the
--    public anon key, one REST call listed every institute being pitched, the
--    price quoted to each, and every demo not yet sent. A pitch page is meant to
--    be reachable by the one person holding its link, not enumerable. Now anon
--    reads a pitch page only when it is live and a demo only when it is sent,
--    which is exactly what the site's own routes already serve.
--
-- WHO IS THE ADMIN
-- The one line to check before running is the INSERT into public.admins below.
-- It must be the email you use to log in at /admin (the user you create under
-- Authentication > Users). If it is wrong nothing breaks for visitors: /admin
-- simply cannot save, and you add the right one with the same INSERT.
