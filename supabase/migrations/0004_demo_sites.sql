-- Ideovent Technologies, demo sites: the private slot and the open log
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ---------------
-- A demo site is the institute's OWN website, built for them and served at
-- ideovent.vercel.app/site/<their-name>. The record has to be readable by
-- `anon`, because the whole point is that the director opens the link without
-- an account. So `demoSites` is public content, like `projects` and
-- `pitchPages`, and it needs nothing from this file: the policy written by 0003
-- already lets anyone select any collection that is not named in its exclusion
-- list.
--
-- Two collections BESIDE it are a different matter, and they are what this
-- migration is for. Each one is the half of a decision that the browser cannot
-- argue with, because hiding a value in a React component fixes nothing: it is
-- still in the payload.
--
--   demoSiteSlots   Mehdi's private slot beside each demo. It holds `sentTo`,
--                   which is a named human being ("Mrs Rao, principal, by
--                   WhatsApp"), and `internalNotes`, which is where somebody
--                   writes what they actually think of a prospect. On a
--                   world-readable row that is one View Source away from the
--                   person it is about, on a page built to flatter them. Same
--                   mechanism, same reasoning, as `pitchPageNotes` in 0003.
--
--   demoSiteOpens   One row per browser session that opened a demo. When and
--                   how often a named institute read a page is information
--                   about THEM, not about us, so only a signed-in admin may
--                   read it. But it has to be WRITTEN by the public page, which
--                   runs as `anon`, and that is the insert policy below.
--
-- WHY THE OPEN COUNT IS ROWS AND NOT A COUNTER FIELD. `anon` cannot UPDATE any
-- row in this table, and 0001 is right not to let it: an anonymous visitor able
-- to update `public.content` could rewrite the site. So a counter living on the
-- demo record would sit at zero for ever and be indistinguishable from nobody
-- having opened the link, which is the one reading Mehdi must never be given
-- falsely, because he decides whether to follow up on it. What `anon` CAN be
-- given is a narrow insert, so an open is a new row and the number is a count.
-- `openCount` and `lastOpenedAt` are therefore DERIVED and never stored: see
-- `demoOpenStats` in src/lib/demo/slots.ts.
--
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`) AFTER 0003.
-- Re-running it is safe.

-- ── Read ──────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Replaces the policy last written by 0003. The two new collections join the
-- list of collections anonymous visitors may not select.
-- KEEP THIS LIST IDENTICAL TO PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS in src/lib/cms/types.ts.
drop policy if exists "read public content" on public.content;
create policy "read public content" on public.content
  for select
  using (collection not in (
    'submissions',
    'applications',
    'certificateGrades',
    'pitchPageNotes',
    'demoSiteSlots',
    'demoSiteOpens'
  ));

-- "read all authed" from 0001 is unchanged: a signed-in admin still reads
-- everything, which is what /admin -> Demo sites needs in order to show the
-- slot fields and the open count at all.

-- ── Write ─────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Replaces the policy written by 0001. `anon` may now insert into one more
-- collection, and one only.
--
-- THE INSERT IS DELIBERATELY NOT PAIRED WITH A SELECT. A visitor may add an
-- open and can never read the log back, so nobody can enumerate which
-- institutes were sent a demo by asking the database for the list. Write-only
-- is the correct shape for a tally that is nobody's business but ours.
--
-- The row it writes is tiny and carries no identity: a demo id and a
-- timestamp, and nothing about the reader. See src/lib/demo/opens.ts, which
-- also keeps it to one row per browser session so a refresh does not inflate
-- the number Mehdi is reading.
drop policy if exists "insert leads anon" on public.content;
create policy "insert leads anon" on public.content
  for insert to anon
  with check (collection in ('submissions', 'applications', 'demoSiteOpens'));

-- ── Belt and braces ───────────────────────────────────
-- If a private slot field is ever written onto a PUBLIC demo record by an older
-- build or a hand-edited import, strip it. The demo record is world-readable;
-- who it was sent to is not.
update public.content
   set data = data - 'sentTo' - 'internalNotes' - 'internalName' - 'notes'
 where collection = 'demoSites'
   and (data ? 'sentTo' or data ? 'internalNotes'
        or data ? 'internalName' or data ? 'notes');

-- Verification. All of these should return zero rows.
--
--   set role anon;
--   select count(*) from public.content where collection = 'demoSiteSlots';
--   select count(*) from public.content where collection = 'demoSiteOpens';
--   select count(*) from public.content
--    where collection = 'demoSites' and (data ? 'sentTo' or data ? 'internalNotes');
--   reset role;
--
-- And this one should return the demo sites, which is correct:
--   set role anon;
--   select data->>'slug', data->>'status' from public.content where collection = 'demoSites';
--   reset role;
--
-- A DRAFT demo IS readable by anon at the database level, exactly as a draft
-- pitch page is, and for the same reason: this is a single-table public content
-- store and the status gate is in `resolveDemoSite()`, which renders the 404.
-- It is not a secret-keeping mechanism. Do not put anything in a draft record
-- that would matter if it were read. The fields that would are in the slot,
-- which is why the slot is a separate collection.
