-- Ideovent Technologies: make intern rubric grades admin-only
--
-- WHY THIS EXISTS
-- ---------------
-- Until 24 Sep 2026 the numeric rubric total of every certified intern was a field
-- on the certificate record itself. `certificates` is public by design: the whole
-- point of /verify/<id> is that a stranger can read it without an account: so the
-- rubric total of two real, named private individuals was readable by
-- anyone who opened the page, fetched public/certificates.json, or read the JS
-- bundle. Mehdi confirmed on 24 Sep 2026 that the numeric grade comes off the
-- public view.
--
-- Hiding the row in the React component would have fixed none of that: the value
-- was still in the payload. So the grade moved to its OWN collection, and this
-- migration is the half of that move that the browser cannot argue with: the
-- `anon` role simply gets no rows back for it.
--
-- Run this in the Supabase SQL editor (or `supabase db push`) AFTER 0001.
-- Re-running it is safe.

-- ── Read ──────────────────────────────────────────────
-- Replaces the policy created in 0001. `certificateGrades` joins the two lead
-- collections on the list of things anonymous visitors may not select.
-- Keep this list identical to PRIVATE_COLLECTIONS in src/lib/cms/types.ts.
drop policy if exists "read public content" on public.content;
create policy "read public content" on public.content
  for select
  using (collection not in ('submissions', 'applications', 'certificateGrades'));

-- "read all authed" from 0001 is unchanged: a signed-in admin still reads
-- everything, which is what /admin → Certificates needs in order to show the
-- grade field at all.

-- ── Belt and braces ───────────────────────────────────
-- If a grade is ever written back onto a certificate document by an older build
-- or a hand-edited import, strip it. A certificate row is public; a grade is not.
update public.content
   set data = data - 'grade'
 where collection = 'certificates'
   and data ? 'grade';

-- Verification. Both of these should return zero rows.
--
--   set role anon;
--   select count(*) from public.content where collection = 'certificateGrades';
--   select count(*) from public.content where collection = 'certificates' and data ? 'grade';
--   reset role;
